         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Right Honorable &amp; moſt Honored Madam.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y ambition to invite your Honour to be Surety to my Firſt-Borne, hath offered violence to my modeſty in this Dedication, yet I know not why I may not dedicate my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours unto you, to whom I have long agoe dedicated my ſelfe. When I had once the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to entertaine your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for a very ſhort time, I found you ſo ready to take meane things in the beſt part,
<pb facs="tcp:65386:3"/>that I do the leſs ſcruple here to invite you to take part of the Churches Ordinary.</p>
            <p>The great Salvation that this weak hand holds out, may well beſeeme the greateſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, not only to own, but to have in higheſt eſtimation; and I am perſwaded, that you have ſo long made the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it (next to God the Giver, and Chriſt the Purchaſer of it) your chiefeſt intereſt, that you have now, with your nameſake in the Goſpel, made the better part ſo ſure unto you, that it can never be taken from
<pb facs="tcp:65386:3"/>you: yet dear Madam, it is not unknown unto you that ſin is ſo deceitfull to deceive, and the heart ſo deceitfull to be deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that we can ſee ſmall ground of ſecurity (though ſome of ſafety) on this ſide Heaven: Its our taking heed of falling that keepes us ſtanding; and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veats againſt ſin and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation may be of excellent uſe to keep the Soul in awe; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Dr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Sibbs</hi> tells us that fear is the awe-band of the ſoul.</p>
            <p>I am not inſenſible that Scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers may ſay, that here is more Porch than houſe: but that was
<pb facs="tcp:65386:4"/>ſo far from being an overſight, that it was a part of my deſign: I dare not incloſe, nor impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate that which the Apoſtle hath called the common Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation <hi>Jude.</hi> 3. v. That my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall City that was called the holy <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> deſcending from Heaven, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.10. Tipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Church, was ſaid to have 12 Gates, which noted out the confluence of Beleivers that ſhould come into the preaching of the Goſpel, and ſhould fly unto that great Salvation like Doves unto their windows and the diſcourſe herein offered is ſo
<pb facs="tcp:65386:4"/>like the Pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> a common Bath, or Fountaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened for ſin and for unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that I thought it conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make the more Porches; and if I could direct a particular Epiſtle to every particular Soul, the Soules excellency would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit me from folly in ſo doing.</p>
            <p>I have deſervedly given your Honour the Preeminence, in opening unto you the firſt Gate, and the more to enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it, have written your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable name upon it; that it may be called beautifull, and followers may throng in after
<pb facs="tcp:65386:5"/>you, and when they are entred (if they will but learne of you) they may count the feet (and much more the faces) of them beautifull that bring unto their Soules the glad tidings of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>But when they have made their entrance they will find that here is houſe as well as porch, yea and that it is very roomthy: for theſe three Stories Salvation, Sin, and Damnation do reſemble Heaven, Earth, and Hell.</p>
            <p>Salvation hath Heaven at the top of it, and Damnation
<pb facs="tcp:65386:5"/>hath Hell at the bottome of it, and Sin (like its Father the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell) having the whole Earth for its walke, is the worſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion that the ſonns of men have.</p>
            <p>Madame, you are here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with a ſtrange ſight, a poor ſinner hanging betwixt Heaven and Hell; if he will but accept of Salvation offered, Heaven is his; but if he neglect <hi>in this his day to know the things that belong unto his Peace,</hi> he will fall into Hell, and ther's no eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It's a ſad thing to ſee ſo many wallowing in ſin, like
<pb facs="tcp:65386:6"/>ſwine in the myre, under ſuch warnings, and very ſad to ſee many of the Godly to drive ſo low and dull a trade with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that it may be ſayd of them as of poor Tradeſmen, whom the World favours not, that they are ſtill buying &amp; ſelling, and live by the loſſe.</p>
            <p>What ſad lives do we lead, and what comfortable lives do we loſe, by not bringing our practiſes up to the principles of inviſible Chriſtianity; and for want of more intimate acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the beauty of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and power of godlines;
<pb facs="tcp:65386:6"/>
               <hi>Gregory</hi> the great was ſaid to be the laſt of the good Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> and firſt of the bad; his life was ſuch a medley of good and evill, and therefore ſome Interpreters have thought him to be that Angell in the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> that was ſaid to fly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Heaven and Earth. And <hi>Salomon's</hi> life was ſo particolou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that an antient Limner drew him halfe in Heaven and halfe in Hell; and ſuch is the pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull caſe of many a Chriſtian, they do ſo halt betwixt God and the World, &amp; ſo half it betwixt the Spirit and the Fleſh, that
<pb facs="tcp:65386:7"/>they may be thought, by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as well as others, to hang equally poyſed betwixt Fear of Hell, and Hope of Heaven, Oh how low are ſouls in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations, for want of cloſe and circumſpect walking, and for want of a laborious and coſtly ſerving of God?</p>
            <p>Madam, you may here ſtand ſafe upon the Rock of your ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and behold the dead, and red Sea of the Almighties wrath, upon which multitudes of dead Souls ly floating like the Carcaſes of the drowned Aegyptians when the Iſraelites
<pb facs="tcp:65386:7"/>were paſſed over. And while you are ſtanding upon ſafe ground, you may here behold that Rock of Goſpel-refuſing which hath ſhipwrack'd many, and that Gulfe of Damnation which hath devoured them; whereas you, through Grace, are brought nere unto the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and within ſight of the Haven where you would be: Let Faith and Patience hold out but a little longer, for yet a little while he that ſhall come will come and will not tarry.</p>
            <p>So deſiring that the God only wiſe may guide you with
<pb facs="tcp:65386:8"/>his Counſell, and ſtabliſh your Mind &amp; Heart with his Truth and Grace, and lead you through militant holineſs into tryumphant happineſs, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly crave pardon for this bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, take leave, and reſt,</p>

            <p>My painfull Predeceſſor (now with God) was a faithfull labourer in this vineyard above forty years, and ſhall it be ſaid of you, as it was once ſaid of gainſaying and refuſing Iſrael, <hi>forty years long was I grieved with this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration?</hi>

            <p>What ſucceſſe the Goſpel hath had with your Soules, I muſt leave to your own conſciences, and to the ſearcher of hearts; I am loath to print my thoughts, leaſt I ſhould be conſtrained to ſpeak the Apoſtles language, 1 Cor. 15.34. <hi>Some have not the knowledge of God, I ſpeake this to your ſhame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you have embraced the Goſpel, you have bought the field in which the hid treaſure is, and though you are never ſo poor, and mean of birth, you are richer far, and more honourable than graceleſs Kings, and Chriſtleſs Monarchs.</p>

            <p>Oh perſiſt not in refuſing this great Salvation, you have had many offers, and one muſt be the laſt, and the more are paſt, the neerer the laſt is, and who knowes if this be not the laſt that ever ſhall be made to ſome of you?

Pſal.</hi> 50.16, 17.</p>
            <p>Salvation is ſuch a myſtery of miraculous mercy, that the very <hi>Angells</hi> do delight <hi>to pry into is,</hi> 1. Pet. 1.12. And as they were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring Spirits to the great Saviour when he was upon Earth, ſo they are glad to be <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring Spirits to the heyres of</hi> this great <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Heb. 1.14. A Meſſenger coming from the dead, and from that triumphant community of juſt and perfect Soules, were fitter to ſpeak to you of ſuch a theam, than one that's going to the dead, and is yet clothed with the raggs of mortality and corruption: If ſuch a one ſhould hear us expreſſing our low conceptions of ſuch ſublime myſteries as accompany Salvation, he wouldſay as the Queen of the South of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:65386:28"/>wiſdome, that one half is not told you in your own Country; If the Divell and damned Soules might hear but one Sermon more of Salvation with hope of obtaining it, can you think that they would be ſo regardles, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent as the common ſort of hearers are? Do you think that the divells themſelves (which <hi>beleeve</hi> the dreadfullneſs of perfected damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>and tremble</hi> to beleeve it) would ſay to ſuch a preacher as <hi>Foelix</hi> did to <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 24, 25. <hi>Go thy way for this time, and when I have a more convenient ſeaſon I will call for thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>unum magnum,</hi> the <hi>unicum maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum;</hi> the great thing that the Apoſtle indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to ſecure in this place, that none of Chriſts blood may be loſt, that none of his own Miniſteriall labour may be labour in vaine: In a word his drift and ſcope is that that Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which was ſo great in the <hi>operation,</hi> and in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> ſhould be as great in the Worlds <hi>acceptation.</hi> Chriſt had wrought it out, who was the Son of God, higher than Angells, <hi>the great Prophet, and Prieſt, and King of his Church,</hi> as this Epiſtle declares at large.</p>
            <p>The Goſpel had brought it to light, which is <hi>the glorious Goſpel of the bleſſed God,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.11. which makes Salvation neerer and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65386:29"/>clearer than the law did. And therefore if we accep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it not, <hi>how ſhall we eſcape?</hi> that is to ſay, there is no poſſib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ity of eſcaping.</p>
            <p>One of the Ancients hath laid down this Rule as Gods method of dealing with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuiers of his mercy. <hi>Ingentia beneficia, flagitia, ſupplicia.</hi> Where God offers, or beſtowes great me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cies, there the ſetting light by thoſe mercies are ſinns with an high hand, and thoſe great ſinns draw down proportionable puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Now according to this Rule.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What mercy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Apoſtles words here conſidered as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the context, may be exactly reduced to hat rule; we ſhall therefore from ſuch premiſes draw theſe three naturall concluſions, as the plaine reſults of this Scripture.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Salvation brought to light by the Goſpel is great Salvation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That ſetting light by ſuch Salvation is great ſin.</p>

               </head>
               <p>BEfore we open the doore to let you into a clear ſight of this truth, it may not be impertinent to remove an objection that lies as a ſtumbling block at the very entrance, and that is this. In that we proclaime Goſpel-Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to be great Salvation, ſome may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand whether there be any other Salvation that may ſtand in competition with Goſpel-Salvation?</p>
               <p>To which we anſwer, that God never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed but two wayes unto mankind for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The firſt was by a Covenant of workes, manifeſted unto the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> as the Worlds repreſentative, wherein the condition was <hi>Hoc fac &amp; vive, do this and thou ſhalt live,</hi> or do this and be ſaved.</p>
               <p>But that Law being tranſgreſſed, and that Covenant broken; and <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity being under the curſe of that Covenant, and the wrath of God abiding on them: God was pleaſed to enter into another Covenant of grace with mankind through the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:65386:30"/>propoſing unto them another condition, <hi>Hoc crede &amp; vive, whoſoever beleeveth in him ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life Iohn.</hi> 3.16. Though there was an old way to Salvation by working held out by the law, yet now <hi>the new and living way,</hi> brought to light by the Goſpel, is the way of beleeving; and this Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by the Covenant of grace doth as farr excell that by the Covenant of workes, as the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> doth excell the firſt.</p>
               <p>I may further adde, that the Covenant of grace hath been exhibited under two diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations.</p>
               <p>Firſt to the Jewes, under the old Teſtament-diſpenſation, in tipes and ſhadowes, when the Ceremoniall Law was the Jewes Goſpel.</p>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65386:36"/>righteouſneſs of the law in his active obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for the juſtification of ſinners; but Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from ſin, which is d ne <hi>in Sanctification, is quiddam interius,</hi> the work of Chriſt within us, who <hi>workes all our workes in us, as</hi> well as for us.

               <p>And as it is from ſin, ſo from all ſin that lies within the reach of repentance: There is a ſin indeed which the Scripture hath excepted, called <hi>the ſin unto death,</hi> and <hi>the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which is therefore impardonable, becauſe the ſinner is impenitent, and becauſe that ſin is alwayes twin'd with a totall, and finall apoſtacy; otherwiſe there is no ſin ſo great but may be pardoned, no ſinner ſo great but may be ſaved.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 <hi>The Revelation of the ſpirit,</hi> It is the ſpirit of God that hath brought Salvation to light through the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>The word is but the letter, the ſpirit is the inditer and penman of it, <hi>all Scripture being given by divine inſpiration</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. And therefore as it is called <hi>the ſword of the ſpirit,</hi> ſo it may be called <hi>the word of the ſpirit.</hi> Its true that men were the penmen of Scripture, or rather the penns in the hand of a ready writer, as the Apoſtle ſaid he was <hi>Gods pen to write Gods Epiſtle in the fleſhly tables of the hearts of the Corinthians,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.2, 3. And therefore its ſaid <hi>that no propheſy of Scripture is of any private interpretation, but holy men of God wrote as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. And in the beginning of this Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> The writer of it ſaith, <hi>God at ſundry times, and in diverſe manners
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65386:48"/>ſpake to our fathers by his ſervants the prophets, &amp;c.</hi> but eſpecially take notice of the verſe that follows my text. <hi>How ſhall we eſcape if we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſo great Salvation, which at firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that hear him? God alſo bearing them witneſs both with ſignes, and wonders, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own will:</hi> it was the Holy Ghoſt that ſealed up the truth of the Goſpel by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe miracles.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle therefore calleth the ſpirit <hi>the great Teacher.</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.27. <hi>Ye need not that any man teach you but as the ſame anointing teacheth you all things,</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.27. And the ſpirit is ſaid to reveale that in the word to the ſpirituall man, which the word without the ſpirit cannot make the naturall man to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 2.9, 10. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor care heard, neither hath entred into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them unto us by his ſpirit, for the ſpirit ſearcheth all things even the deep things of God, And the</hi> Apoſtle prayes that God would come in with the <hi>ſpirit of wiſedome</hi> upon <hi>the word of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> and with <hi>the ſpirit of revelation</hi> upon <hi>the word of revelation, to his Epheſians; Eph.</hi> 1, 17.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 The <hi>Application</hi> of the ſpirit. As this Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is from the ſpirits revelation, ſo hath it its efficacy from the ſpirits application. Its the ſpirit that muſt bring <hi>our hearts to the word,</hi> as well as <hi>the word to our hearts,</hi> that muſt ſpeak us through, and ſay to our blind eyes, deafe eares, and dead hearts be opened, ſee, and hear, and underſtand, and be converted, and he healed, Its the ſpirit that muſt perſwade us to recieve, entertaine, and embrace Chriſt, that muſt ſay to our underſtandings, and wills, and hearts, <hi>lift up your heads O ye gates, and be ye opened ye everlaſting dores, that the King of glory may enter in,</hi> when the <hi>dead letter</hi> of the word, and <hi>a dead heart</hi> meet, there can be but <hi>dead worke,</hi> till the ſpirit of life, that free wind that blowes where it liſts, do blow through that word upon the Soul, that ſpirit that indited the word can make it the ſavour of life, and that ſpirit that formed the heart, and ſearcheth the heart, can ſay unto dead hearts live. In this reſpect it is that we are ſaid to be <hi>drawne to Chriſt Iohn.</hi> 6.44. and to be <hi>made beleevers by the exceeding greatneſs of his power, and according to the working of his mighty power, Eph.</hi> 1.19. Now in that the Goſpel needed ſo glorious a revelation and ſo powerfull an application, and both by
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65386:49"/>the ſpirit, our Salvation wrought by it muſt be confeſſed to be great Salvation.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. We begin with <hi>grace:</hi> The word ſaith <hi>Titus.</hi> 2.12. <hi>The grace of God which bringeth
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65386:49"/>Salvation teacheth us to deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live holily, juſtly, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly in this preſent World:</hi> where the Apoſtle teacheth us that it is grace that makes us to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in duty, and therefore to that end that we may <hi>abound in the worke of the Lord,</hi> which the Apoſtle preſſes, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>ult,</hi> we are taught by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> to abound in grace, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7, 8. giving all dilligence adde unto your faith &amp;c. and then it follows, <hi>If theſe things be in you and abound, they make you that you ſhall neither be barren, nor unfruitfull in the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Note the graces <hi>of faith, vertue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godlineſs, brotherly kindneſs, love,</hi> muſt <hi>not only be in us, but they muſt abound in us,</hi> in order to this great Salvation. And the fruits of the ſpirit, that the heyres of Salvation muſt indeavour to abound in, are laid downe in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cluſter <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22, 23. <hi>The fruits of the ſpirit are love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, goodneſs, faith, meekneſs, temperance, theſe, and all</hi> the reſt of the traine of heavenly graces do accompany Salvation, and it muſt needes be <hi>great Salvation</hi> that is <hi>ſo greatly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,</hi>

My bretheren be ye ſtedfaſt, and unmovable, alwayes abounding in the worke of the Lord, for as much as you know that your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is not in vaine in the Lord.</hi> And it was not only his precept but his practiſe to, he did not like the Scribes and Phariſes bind heavy burdens to lay upon others ſhoulders, but he taught them by his own example to bear them too: <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.13, 14. <hi>This one thing I do, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting thoſe things which are behind, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth unto the things that are before I preſs towards the marke, for the price of the high call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> whereupon one of the Fathers call'd him <hi>inſatiabilis dei cultor, an unſatisfied, greedy worſhipper of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> Gods workmen ſhould be the beſt, and good workmen can never want worke, did not our God lay enough upon them, in the duties of <hi>holineſs, righteousneſs,</hi> and <hi>ſobriety,</hi> which is the <hi>Epitome of the morall Law.</hi> Did not Chriſt lay enough upon them in charging them to <hi>keep his Commandemeuts out of love,</hi> and that their faith work by love, which is <hi>the Epitome both of Law and Goſpel.</hi> Their own deceitfull hearts will find them enough, The alluring <hi>world,</hi> the enticing <hi>fleſh,</hi> and ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>devill</hi> will afford them but a little breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

                  <p n="3">3. Next for <hi>Ordinances,</hi> what tendency have all theſe, but the furtherance of this Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? The <hi>word</hi> that Converting, and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying ordinance is it not <hi>the word of life and Salvation:</hi> May I not ſay unto you. <hi>Men and brethren children of the generation of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and whoſoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this Salvation ſent, Is not the goſpell our Law of life, and the law our rule of life,</hi> leading to this Salvation? doth not Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall grace fit us for legall duty? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult that Scripture <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.12. and you ſhall find it ſo. And for the ſealing ordinances of <hi>Baptiſme and the Supper,</hi> their tendency can be no other, but as ſeales to a deed to the ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making of this Salvation The <hi>Miniſtry</hi> we may
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65386:51"/>ſay of it as the word doth of the Sabboth, that it was made for man, and therefore its reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Churches charter. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. <hi>All things are yours, whether</hi> Paul, <hi>or</hi> Apollo, <hi>or</hi> Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus <hi>&amp;c.

Eph.</hi> 4.12, 13. Wherefore hath God given us his <hi>Sabboth,</hi> but that we ſhould make it our delight, if Salvation be our delight? wherefore hath he appointed the ordinance of <hi>prayer</hi> as a <hi>Catholicon,</hi> as univerſall <hi>food,</hi> and <hi>Phiſick</hi> for our Soules, as neceſſary as our daily bread, and daily pardon, as the fourth and fift Petition of the Lords prayer note; yea, the very <hi>diſcipline of the Church, Chriſtian reprooſes, and rebukes, and excommunication</hi> it ſelfe aimes <hi>at the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the unruly, &amp; at the deſtruction of the fleſh that the ſpirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly for <hi>Providences,</hi> how ſtrangely doth God worke for the heires of Salvation,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65386:51"/>though the word be the ordinary means for the converſion of a ſinner, yet how ordinarily is ſome afflictive providence ſingled out to ſet it home, to weane unbelevers and ſuch as ſtick at a halfe converſion, like a child in the birth, and to make them more then <hi>all-moſt Chriſtians,</hi> when ſouls do hang <hi>in aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librio,</hi> and do as it were halt betwixt God and the world, or fleſh, its uſually ſome pinching affliction that turnes the ſcales, and cauſes the ſinner to turne his heart, and feet unto Gods teſtimonies: Thoſe that keep Catalogues of providences, can draw out choice of experiences out of their full qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: They can tell you with <hi>David</hi> who <hi>delivered them out of the paw of the Lion and Bear.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.37. and can with <hi>Paul</hi> record unto Gods glory, <hi>he hath delivered, and doth deliver, in whom we truſt that he will alſo yet deliver.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. Cannot Gods people tell you when they were dead and he put life into them, as the prodigalls Father ſaid of his Son, ſo can they ſay of their ſoules, <hi>this my ſoul was dead and is alive againe, he was loſt, and is found,</hi> Cannot they tell when they were aſleep and he awaked them, when they were in deepes and he ſuccoured them, when they were ruſhing upon ſin like a horſe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65386:52"/>into the battle, and he withheld them, as he did <hi>David</hi> from hurting <hi>Nabal,</hi> by the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of <hi>Abigal,</hi> yea, they can record thankfully the very ordinances, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences wherein God appeared to them It, were endleſs to enumerate all, let experient Chriſtians ſupply the reſt out of their own ſtore, while weaker Chriſtians do make uſe of thoſe weake helpes to further their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings in comprehending this truth. And now being come to the uttermoſt of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, let us look back and gather up the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall branches into one bundle, which we need not doubt to call <hi>the bundle of life,</hi> in which all ſaved ſoules are bound up.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The wiſedome, and love of God the Father, who is the <hi>God of our Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>

The Apoſtle prayed for his <hi>Epheſians,</hi> Eph. 3.16, 17, 18, 19. <hi>That God would grant them according to the riches of his glory to be ſtrengthened with might by his ſpirit in the inner man, that Chriſt may dwell in their hearts by faith, that they being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height, and to know the love of Chriſt which, paſſeth knowledge, that they might be filled with the fullneſs of God.</hi> This is the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of our Salvation, the love of God in Chriſt, which is here meaſured out unto us by the word and ſpirit of God in thoſe dimenſions of <hi>breadth,</hi> and <hi>length,</hi> and <hi>depth,</hi> and <hi>height,</hi> and ſaid to <hi>paſs knowledge,</hi> and to comprehend <hi>all the fullneſs of God,</hi> muſt not this have the <hi>length,</hi> and <hi>breadth,</hi> and <hi>depth,</hi> and <hi>height</hi> of ſin in it, muſt it not be <hi>a ſin paſſing knowledge,</hi> muſt not this be <hi>to be filled with all the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſinfullneſs of ſin?</hi> Thoſe that are eaten

<note place="margin">Deus &amp; caelum non patiuntur hyperbolen.</note> as we cannot ſpeak too highly of God, who is the higheſt good, ſo we cannot ſpeak too aggravatingly of this ſin, becauſe it is ſo objectively againſt the higheſt love of the higheſt God, that it is a ſin ſo oppoſite to the higheſt good, is aggravation ſufficient to ſpeak it ſuperlatively great, yet ſince it was promiſed, we ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the comparative, and ſo come in order to the ſuperlative at laſt.</p>

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65386:74"/>its denomination from that place, and is called the ſin of <hi>Sodomy (e. i.)</hi> burning in ſtrange unnaturall luſts, not fit to be named without trembling, this was that that cauſed them to be burnt with ſtrange fire, even with fire and brimſtone from Heaven, as they had abuſed their land, and turn'd it into a Hell of ſin, ſo God raines down from Heaven upon them a Hell of puniſhment, ſomewhat may be yet added towards the aggravation of their ſin, (which was monſtrous enough without cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of guilt) from Iſay. 3.9. <hi>They declare their ſin as</hi> Sodom; <hi>they hide it not,</hi> the meaning is they were ſhameleſs ſinners, they did adde a brazen forhead to their ſtony hearts, and added to the extremity of luſt the extremity of impudence; And if the ſin we are ſpeaking of be more monſtrous than the ſin of <hi>Sodom,</hi> what ſhall we ſay to this? Surely as the Prophet thundring againſt the ſins of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaith, <hi>hear the word of the Lord, ye Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Sodom, hearken to the Law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah,</hi> Iſay 1.10. The Goſpel-<hi>Boanerges</hi> may cry lowder againſt the ſins of <hi>England,</hi> and all ſuch Lands as have lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſun-ſhine of the Goſpel: Hear the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, ye that are greater ſinners than the Princes of <hi>Sodom,</hi> give eare

               <p n="1">1. Goſpel-refuſing is <hi>a refuſing of Chriſt in his prieſtly office,</hi> we begin with that, becauſe here they think themſelves to be cock-ſure, and every one will profeſs their willingneſs to be ſaved by Chriſt, and to be ready to take him to be their Jeſus and Saviour, I eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that ther's a naturall propenſity in man to deſire good for himſelf, and the principle of ſelf-love is ſo deeply rooted, that ſo long as man is maſter of his reaſon, he will not yeild willingly to be miſerable, but we muſt further know that as there is a ſpirituall, ſo there is a carnall deſire of Chriſt and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which cannot be called a ſerving of Chriſt but our ſelves upon him. This may not ſo properly be called a taking of Chriſt, as a catching at him, conſider that Chriſt offers himſelf unto ſinners in the Goſpel in all his offices jointly, and not in any one of them ſingly, and he that will rightly receive him muſt receive him wholly, and not catch at him by piecemeale, we muſt have all Chriſt, or no Chriſt, and therefore we muſt give up our ſelves to be taught by him as by our
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65386:77"/>Prophet, and to be ruled by him as by our King, if we will be ſaved by him as by our Prieſt. Are we willing to take Chriſt for himſelfe, as well as for our ſelves? other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we do fruſtrate the very end of his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us, for we are therefore ſaved by him, that he may be ſerved by us, <hi>in righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and holyneſs all our daies, Luke.</hi> 1.74, 75. To be ſaved from wrath and not from ſin, is but the leſſer halfe of Goſpel Salvation, and ſuch as are not willing of both, can have neither. What God hath joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we muſt not put aſunder; Its a moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenious and unreaſonable thing to be all on the receiving, and nothing on the returning hand, to expect all from him, and to give nothing back, indeed his redeemed ones can give him nothing but his owne, which made the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>Ye are not your owne but are bought with a price, therefore glorify God both with your bodies and ſoules which are his,</hi> and as we muſt give him our whole ſelves, bodies, ſoules, and ſpirits, ſo we muſt take his whole ſelfe as King, Prophet, and Prieſt, if we can be content to be willing diſciples to his propheticall office, and willing ſubjects to his Kingly office, then we may reaſonably, and believingly expect the benefit of his Prie ſtly office, but let us not dreame that

Oh let the covenant-ſervants of the Lord, and ſuch as retaine to his Family conſider this, that thoſe diſhonours wound him moſt which he receives from his favorites, and pretended freinds. And as the abuſers of grace given do ſin with an high hand, ſo the refuſers of grace offered do ſin with a hard heart, and their ſinns are alſo aggravated by the circumſtance of the perſon. None are capable of being guilty of this ſin, but ſuch as live in the ſound, and ſunſhine of the Goſpel, thoſe whom <hi>the day ſtar from one high hath viſited,</hi> and to whom Chriſt is tendered in all his fullneſs.

                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:65386:91"/>when it is no ſuch thing, 1 Cor. 10.12. And <hi>this evill heart of unbeleife will cauſe men to depart from the ever living God.</hi> Heb. 3.12. Therefore I ſpeake of revolters, and Apoſtles, ſome going out unto one ſect, and ſome unto another; railing againſt the Church, and like baſtard children calling their Mother whore, reproaching their Bretheren, with whom they formerly walked in the houſe of God as freinds, looking aſquint upon them as unbaptized Heathens, and branding them to be limbs of Antichriſt, and the Divel; vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Ordinances, as if they were meere arbitrary things, or might be uſed or refuſed at pleaſure, forſaking the publick aſſemblies of Gods people, and preferring their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles before them, which the Apoſtle makes the rod to that grand Apoſtacy, of deſpighting the Spirit of grace, and ſinning the ſin unto death, Heb. 10.25. And revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Miniſtry, wherein they act the parts of ſuch ſick patients as are frantick, that abuſe their Phiſitian that comes in love to cure them. And as thoſe devouring gulphs of <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Hereſy</hi> do ſwallow thouſands, ſo thoſe other two of <hi>world</hi> and <hi>ſelfe</hi> do murder ten thouſands. How many ſerve the Goſpel as <hi>Demas</hi> did <hi>Paul,</hi> forſake the Goſpel to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:65386:91"/>Embrace the world, and the Goſpel muſt give them leave to make proviſions for the fleſh, or elſe it is no Goſpel for them. This is an argument that they did never love God and Chriſt with the prevailing degree of their love, nor preferre their intereſts above the intereſts of the world and fleſh, this ſhews that the number of ſuch is very few, <hi>whoſe hearts are whole with God, and which behave themſelves ſtedfaſtly in his Covenant,</hi> and all this will appear to be but Goſpel-refuſing when we come to application.</p>
               <p>To draw towards a concluſion of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, we need not wonder that it pulls down States, and unchurches Churches, for it was the great Sin that drowned the old world, and its the firebrand that ſhall ſet this on a flame: The old was drowned becauſe <hi>iniquity did abound, and the flames of luſt aid wax hot;</hi> and the new ſhall be burned, becauſe <hi>iniquity ſhall abound, and the love of many ſhall wax cold.</hi> The old was deſtroyd becauſe <hi>Noah,</hi> a preachers of righteousneſs, could not worke upon them, and the new ſhall be deſtroyed, becauſe Gods meſſengers cannot winne upon them. The words of the Goſpel are plaine, <hi>As it was in the dayes of</hi> Noah, <hi>ſo ſhall it be in the dayes when the Son of man ſhall come, for
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:65386:92"/>as in the dayes of</hi> Noah, <hi>they were eating, and drinking, and marrying, ſo in the laſt dayes the ſame ſinns of gluttony, and drunkeneſs and luſt ſhall abound.</hi> Mat. 24.37, 38, 39. So that this is the condemnation all along of States and Churches, of Jews and Gentiles, of the old World and new, <hi>that light is come into the World, and men love darkneſs more than light, becauſe their deeds are evil,</hi> Joh. 3.19. In the 51.

                  <p n="1">1. In taking <hi>no care about it;</hi> To live as if to mind Salvation were no part of our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; we are ſent into this World to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for another, and though we are not ſo ſtraightly confin'd as to do nothing elſe, yet we are under a ſtraight command to do nothing more; and thus much the Apoſtle teaches when he teaches us, <hi>habere tanquam non habentes,</hi> ſo to be poſſeſt of the things of this World, as not to be poſſeſt by them, <hi>and to uſe the World, as though we uſed it not.</hi> Now when inſtead of ſo doing we ſhall uſe the things of another World, as though we uſed them not, pray as if we prayed not, and hear as if we heard not, and take our ſwinge in the World, as if we were ſent into it, as <hi>Leviathan</hi> into the Sea, to take our paſtime therein, or to ſay to our ſouls with the rich glutton, <hi>Soul, take thine eaſe, eat, drink, and be merry, thou haſt Goods enough laid up for many years,</hi> to mind low things, and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65386:93"/>neglect high things, to have an high eſteem of low things, and a low eſteem of high things, is groſſely to neglect this great Salvation, and if we look about us in the places where we live, do not the greateſt part live after that careleſs rate? as <hi>Jeaſh</hi> ſaid of <hi>Baal let</hi> Baal <hi>care for himſelf,</hi> Judges, 6.31. when his Altar was pulled down by his Son <hi>Gideon,</hi> ſo too many are ready to ſay in works, though not in words, let God take care for himſelf, and for his own ſervice: If his name be diſhonoured, his Son and Spirit abuſed, his Day prophaned, his Embaſſadors vilified, his Ordinances and Worſhip ſlighted and diſgraced, it may be ſaid of very many that would take it ill, not to be counted Chriſtians, as it was of <hi>Gallio,</hi> when the Apoſtles were under ſufferings, that <hi>Gallio cared for none of thoſe things,</hi> Acts, 18.17. ſo that men may but have their wealth, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and honour, let <hi>Zion</hi> ſink or ſwim, let it fare how it will with the Church and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that is none of their care.</p>
                  <p>And this careleſneſſe is the more aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe things of far leſs concernment are ſeriouſly minded by them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Their <hi>bodies</hi> ſhall be cared for, if in health they will pamper them, though they ſuffer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der never ſo much leanneſs of ſoul, they will

                  <p n="2">2.

Joh. 2.15. <hi>And theſe cares of the World, and deceitfulneſs of riches are ſaid to choak the

This worldly gain is the ſouls loſs, not only loſs to the ſoul, but loſs of the ſoul, and <hi>what will it profit a man though he ſhould gain the World, if he loſe his own ſoul,</hi> Matt. 16.26. <hi>Thoſe that be rich do fall into a ſnare, and into many noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom luſts, which drown the ſoul in perdition,</hi> 1.

                  <p>In a word, <hi>Pleaſures, Profits, Honours,</hi> which are the Worlds Trinity, and <hi>ſelf-ſeeking,</hi> or <hi>fleſh pleaſing,</hi> which are the ſame in Unity: Theſe are the great <hi>Diana's</hi> which the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude do adore, and cry up, and theſe they will have though they have Hell with them, and this great Salvation, and the eternal weight of Glory ballanced with theſe, are in the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65386:95"/>of theſe men lighter than vanity it ſelf, and theſe are notorious neglecters of this Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The neglect of this great Salvation is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd by taking but <hi>a little care conjunct with greater cares.</hi> Many, becauſe it is too too groſſe and abominable, and the very badge of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates to give up themſelves wholly to the World, Fleſh and Devil, and to ſerve ſin in the luſt of it, they will divide themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and the World, God and the Fleſh, God and the Devil; They will give God and Chriſt their names and tongues; but the World, Fleſh and Devil ſhall have their hands and hearts, they will pretend to ſerve God, but keep their ſins; But the word is plain that <hi>we cannot ſerve two Maſters, ther's no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God and</hi> Mammon: <hi>O cleanſe your hands ye ſinners, and purge your hearts ye double min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> if God muſt have the whole heart, and ſtrength, the whole body, ſoul and ſpirit, what remains then for other Lords?

                  </p>
                  <p>Though the Scripture is moſt expreſs that we muſt dedicate all our Talents of time, and gifts, and parts, and intereſts, and callings to the advantage of our great Lord, to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of our generation, to the benefit of other ſouls, and to the furtherance of our own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, yet how ordinary a thing is it for men and women to be of <hi>Agrippa's</hi> temper, almoſt Chriſtians, of a <hi>Laodicean</hi> frame of ſpirit, luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm, and betwixt hot and cold: They will ſometimes read, and perhaps pray in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and come to the Aſſembly on the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth, if their luſts will give them leave, and much of the eaſieſt and cheapeſt part of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion they will practice, and be willing to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture as far as a name to live, and a form of godlineſs will bear them out, but ſtill with <hi>Herod</hi> they will ſet themſelves a ſtint, hitherto they will go, and no further, ere his right eye ſhould out by parting with his <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias,</hi> his reprovers head ſhould off, and ere theſe will cut off their right hands, by forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their evil practiſes, and their right feet by forgoing their evil company, and ſaying, away

Offer ſacrifice, burne incence, and obſerve dayes, and like haſty meſſengers run away with half their errand, leaving all of ſubſtance and power behind them; but for cloſe and coſtly ſervices theſe are hard and irkſome, God muſt have them excuſed for ſuch, and for the ſuffering part of Chriſtianity, they are meat ſtrangers to that, yea, and very enemies to the croſſe of Chriſt: Theſe are they that in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, pray not, and in hearing, hear not, and uſe the things that tend to Salvation, as though they uſed them not.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They may paſſe for neglecters of this great Salvation, <hi>that do not make it their greateſt care.</hi> God is the higheſt good, and not to love him with the higheſt love, is interpretatively to hate him; Miſtake me not, I do not mean it abſolutely that we muſt love God in the higheſt degree here, while we are in our imperfect militant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to know but in part, to be ſanctifyed
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:65386:97"/>but in part, and to love but in part. We may love ſincerely on earth, but we ſhall not love perfectly till we come to Heaven, where <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect love ſhall caſt out all fear,</hi> but my meaning is, that in a comparative ſenſe we ſhould love him beſt, and moſt, more than the creature, or our ſelves, more than the intereſts of the world or fleſh, for whoſoever loveth the World, or any thing in the World more than God, is not worthy of him, and whoſoever loves not God and Chriſt more than any thing, than all things in the World, loves them not in ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; Thoſe that are lovers of pleaſures more than lovers of God, lovers of <hi>Mammon</hi> more than lovers of God, they are not better than haters of God. Salvation by Chriſt is the greateſt happineſs, and therefore our greateſt care and pains ſhould be ſpent upon it: It's the <hi>unum neceſſarium,</hi> the only thing neceſſary, and therefore ought to be the <hi>unicum maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi> that ſhould carry away the flowre and cream of our affections and indeavours. It's common with the vulgar to judge of the things of the third Heaven, as they do by the things of the ſecond, the Moon and the Stars; they think the Moon to be biggeſt, becauſe it is neareſt, and ſeems ſo; when ſtars of a greater magnitude are thought little, becauſe they are
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65386:97"/>farther off; So we are ready to look upon the periſhing vanities of this tranſitory World, as great matters, becauſe they are at hand, and near us, and the joyes of Heaven, and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties above to be but ſmall and inconſiderable, becauſe they are far above, and out of our ſight.</p>
                  <p>But you have heard before, that the Scripture bids us <hi>ſtrive to enter in at the ſtreight Gate, and to give all diligence to make all ſure, and to offer violence to the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> and tells us that <hi>the righteous are ſcarcely ſaved,</hi> and with greateſt difficulty, and therefore not to lay out our ſelves, our whole ſelves, and that to our uttermoſt poſſibility, is to be neglecters of this great Salvation. Now the good Lord be mercifull to us, and help us, and give us ſeeing eyes, hearing eares, and underſtanding hearts, to hear, and feele and conſider this, for if this be to neglect this great Salvation, not to make it our higheſt care, not to beſtow the moſt ſerious thoughts of our minds, the moſt ardent deſires of our hearts, and the moſt effectuall indeavours of our lives upon it, what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come (not of looſe and carnall libertines) but of the greateſt part of thoſe that take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and are taken by others to be good Chriſtians.</p>

                  <p>When the ſinner is grieved becauſe God and his Spirit are grieved, God doth as it were
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:65386:101"/>ſympathize with them, and grieve for them, <hi>he's ſorry for our afflictions, and repents him of the evil,</hi> Joel, 2.13. <hi>and his ſoul was grieved for the miſery of Iſrael,</hi> Judges, 10.16. <hi>and I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them,</hi> Jer. 18.8. I know the Scripture opens a wide door of hope to faithful prayers in times of greateſt diſtreſs, in that gracious promiſe, <hi>whoſoever ſhall call on the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Rom. 10.13. but its phyſick that is adminiſtred with this corrective, in the very next words. <hi>But how ſhall they call on him in whom they have not believed?</hi> The prayer of faith will not only recover health in ſickneſs, but life in death, but it is not every call, nor loud cry that is a prayer; not every one that can ſay Lord, Lord can pray, and God told the Iſraelites that <hi>they did not pray unto him when they howled upon their beds.</hi> Hoſ. 7.14. Ther's a vaſt difference betwixt <hi>ſaying</hi> a prayer, &amp; <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> a prayer; the words of prayer are but the carcaſe of the duty, the longing deſites of the ſoul after God and his mercies, after gifts, and giver are the ſoul of it, and that only that makes the prayer effective.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I ſay that ſuch ſinners as Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refuſers may find mercy, there muſt be deepeſt humiliations, ſuitable repentance, and moſt
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:65386:102"/>tervent prayers. Old weather-beaten ſinners <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

But here I muſt enter a caveat againſt a miſtake, let all thought of meriting be baniſht from our ſevereſt, and moſt mortifying humiliations. Though we ſhould macerate our ſelves with faſting into very <hi>Skelitons,</hi> and be like ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pale corpſes, or wandring ſhadows, though we could ſigh our ſelves into very aire, and diſſolve into very teares, <hi>our heads being fountaines and our eyes rivers:</hi> Yet when all were done we muſt cry out <hi>unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,</hi> and we muſt fly from our beſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances

                  <p n="4">4 There muſt be <hi>great changes of heart,</hi> from ſtone to fleſh is a great change, and when God pours out his cleane water of ſanctification, he <hi>takes away the heart of ſtone, and gives the heart of fleſh,</hi> Ezek. 36.26.

For one that was ſo mad upon taking away the lives of others for profeſſing Chriſt, to be more ready to lay downe his own upon the ſame account, was ſo notable a change, that all that hear of

And he makes it the Character of a bleſſed man that he <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terciſeth himſelfe in Gods Law day and night,</hi> Pſal. 1.2.

The bloud of Chriſt was ſo ſavingly ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, that it healed thoſe that wounded him, and gave life to ſome of thoſe murderers that put him to death, as is evident from that plain Scripture Acts. 2.36, 37, 38. <hi>Peter</hi> told them <hi>God had made that Jeſus whom they cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified both Lord and Chriſt.</hi> There we ſee they were ſuch as had a hand in crucifying Chriſt, The next verſe ſhews that they were penitent, and pricked at the heart for that ſin, and begging directions of the Apoſtles what they might do to be ſaved, they were directed to repent and incouraged with the hopes of the promiſe, and v. 41. <hi>They gladly received the word and there were added to the Church three thouſand Soules, who continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles doctrine and fellowſhip, and in breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of bread, and prayer.</hi> And as the merit of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65386:106"/>Chriſt extended to his very perſecutors ſo the mercy of the Goſpel extends to the refuſers of the Goſpel. That Son, that ſaid he would not go into the vinyeard and went, was better accepted with the Father, than he that ſaid I go Sr. and went not. So thoſe that have long ſtood at a diſtance from God upon their unfained repentance will be better accepted than ſuch as are forward in profeſſion and ſhew, but have nothing of the power, and beauty, and reality of Godlineſs, and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity in them. O what greater incouragement can Rebells have to lay down armes and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt to mercy, than a probability, nay a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall certainty of their Princes pardon: <hi>We have heard that the Kings of</hi> Iſrael <hi>are mercifull</hi> ſaid the ſervants of <hi>Benhadad,</hi> and therefore got ropes about their necks in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of ſubmiſſion, and humbled themſelves, and found mercy according to their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you have heard againe and againe that the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the King of Kings is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, but how mercifull none can tell you, <hi>he is able to do more exceeding abundantly than we are able to ask or think,</hi> let us lie in the duſt, and ſhame our ſelves before him, and turne from our evill wayes, and turne unto the Lord, and as ſure as he is a God of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:65386:106"/>truth we ſhall find him to be a God of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: but if notwithſtanding all theſe allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we ſhall perſiſt in our ſin of ſetting light by the Goſpel, our blood will be upon our own heads, and we ſhall be left to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh without remedy. I ſhall ſhut up all with that obteſtation of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> Chap. 12.1, 2. Which is my intreaty to you, <hi>I beſeech you brethren by the mercies of God, that ye preſent your ſelves a living ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, holy, and acceptable unto God, which is your reaſonable ſervice, &amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:65386:108"/>forward to Ch. 10.27, 28, 29. And what the ſpirit of God ſpeaks ſhort here, is ſpoken out, and at large to the Scribes and Phariſes, hypocrites, that ſlew the Prophets that were ſent unto them, and refuſed ſervants, and Son too, that came to require fruit of the vineyard, Mat. 23.33. <hi>Ye Serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye eſcape the Damnation of Hell?</hi> And obſerve that Mat. 25.41.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1 That it is <hi>Great Damnation</hi> you may eaſily conclude from what is allready ſpoken, that it is the damnation of Hell, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels Damnation, and the very word gives ſuch an aſtoniſhing ſound to ſuch as can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend both name and thing, that to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it to be great, it will need no more than the naming; but ſince we have to do with ſuch as are brutifyed, and muſt <hi>fight with beaſts after the manner of men,</hi> ſince our work lies much with dead men, ſuch as are <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſinns,</hi> and though they bear the names of men and women, that are

               <p>We muſt therefore uſe all poſſible means (and all little enough) to awaken them to things of higheſt Conſequence, and everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Concernment, and ſuch are the things that we have in hand. Matters of Salvation and Damnation, matters of life and death for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>Study with me but this one point, that the Damnation that we are ſpeaking of, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to aggravate is not Damnation barely for the breach of Gods Law, but for refuſing the mercy of the Goſpel, that was offered to make up that breach, its Damnation for the refuſal of Salvation, of which refuſers we may uſe the Apoſtles words, Rom. 3.8. <hi>Whoſe Damnation is juſt.</hi> There can be no greater juſtice than this, when life and death are ſet before men, and they will chooſe death, that they ſhould have it, when Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Damnation are both held out in the promiſe and threatning, that the refuſers of Salvation ſhould fall into damnation, obſerve Ioh. 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world that be gave
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:65386:110"/>his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him might not periſh but have everlaſting life,</hi> and in the next verſe, <hi>God ſent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be ſaved:</hi> In both verſes is declared both <hi>poſivetily,</hi> and <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively</hi> for what end Chriſt came into the world. 1 He came to ſave ſinners, 2 He came to ſave, and not to damne. But as God by his creating power brought light out of darkneſs; ſo men by their deſtroying ſin bring darkneſs out of light, and like the Spiders do ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poyſon from the ſweeteſt flowers, and moſt wholſome hearbs; They do wilfully ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate their condemnation by the gracious offers of Salvation, and treaſure up for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſevereſt wrath from ſweeteſt mercy. And this is that that brings this great damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as you may ſee there in the very next verſe but one, ver. 19. <hi>This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men love dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs more than light,</hi> that mercy is offered and wrath is choſen, that Salvation is tendered, and Damnation is taken, men deal ſo Jewiſhly with Chriſt, that they prefer <hi>Barrabbas</hi> a murderer before him, and this is rightly called <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:65386:111"/>up wrath againſt the day of wrath.</hi> Rom. 2.5. Though they catch many a rap here, that's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in compariſon of what's behind: This is the day of grace, wherein God exerciſeth pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and long-ſuffering towards them, but if the goodneſs of God do not bring them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, there's another day a coming, where they muſt give another manner of reckoning, a fearfull, and terrible day, a day all of Wrath: Then righteous Judgement will be impartially diſpenſed without reſpect of perſons: here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in mens judicatories it falls out oftentimes as with fiſh in a net, great ones are caught, when little ones creep through; and ſometimes again as with flies in the Spiders webb, the little ones are held, when the great ones break through, but that day will ſurprize High and Low, Rich and Poor, one with another, <hi>We muſt all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the Judgement Seat of Chriſt,</hi> 2. Cor. 5.10 <hi>and every one muſt give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of himſelf to God,</hi> Rom. 14.12. If any are left out of theſe expreſſions, <hi>all and every one,</hi> they may expect to eſcape judgement, elſe not.

               <p n="2">2. Greater alſo than condemnation by Gods Law, as appears from the verſe before my text and <hi>Ch.</hi> 10.27, 28, 29, 30, 31. To ſuch as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully refuſe this Goſpel-Salvation, <hi>There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains no Sacrifice for ſins, but a certain fearful looking for of judgement, and fiery indignation, which ſhall devour the adverſaries: He that deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed Moſes law</hi> (i. e.) <hi>Gods law given by the Mediatourſhip of Moſes, died without mercy; of how much ſorer puniſhment ſuppoſe ye ſhall he be thought worthy; who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and counted the blood of the Covenant, wherewith he was ſanctified, an unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing, and hath done deſpite unto the ſpirit of Grace. For we know him that hath ſaid, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance belogneth unto me, I will recompenſe ſaith the Lord, and again the Lord will judge his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. It is a fearfull thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi> So far the Apoſtle in that Scripture, which thunder-claps, though by the concurrent Judgement of expoſitours, they are levelled at ſinners againſt the Holy Ghoſt,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:65386:112"/>thoſe that are guilty of that ſin unto death, yet many of the iniquities of that ſin are (though in a lower meaſure) to be charged upon the neglecter of this great Salvation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is ſuperlatively <hi>the greateſt</hi> of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnations, two places of Scripture I ſhall quote and improve, that are of this tendency, and then ſhall paſs to the further confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it by ſtrength of reaſon.</p>
               <p>The firſt is 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.16. Where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle notes that the <hi>Jews,</hi> that killed the Lord Jeſus and their own Prophets, and perſecuted the Apoſtles, and envyed the Gentiles, that in a word, with the unjuſt Judge did neither fear God, nor reverence Man, did thus <hi>Fill up the meaſure of their ſins, till wrath came upon them to the utter moſt,</hi> (i. e.) they <hi>ſinned to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt</hi> till they were <hi>plagued to the uttermoſt.</hi> compare with this place that <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. which words are ſpoken of Jeſus Chriſt, the great high Prieſt of his Church, the plentiful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer and mighty Saviour, <hi>He is able to ſave to the uttermoſt all them that do come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them:</hi> what can be more equall than this that they that refuſe <hi>mercy to the uttermoſt,</hi> ſhould have <hi>wrath to the uttermoſt,</hi> that they which ſet light by that <hi>Salvation to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,</hi>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:65386:112"/>ſhould indure the <hi>uttermoſt of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other place of Scripture that ſpeaks to this point, and ſerves to ſet out the ſuperlative greatneſs of this Damnation is <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.7. They are the words of <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> to the Phariſees and Saduces, that came to his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, <hi>O Generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come.</hi> Where note that this dreadfull Damnation is called <hi>Wrath to come,</hi> and therefore becauſe the main of it is reſerved for the life to come; true it is that ſome notorious Malefactours have an entrance into Hell opened unto them while they are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, and are hang'd up in Gibbets for the aſtoniſhment of others, that are ſo purſued by the hornets of their conſciences ſtinging them with the pangs of the ſecond death, that with <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> they are driven by the Devil through hell internal into an hell eternal; but the dreadfulneſs of perfected Damnation, which the <hi>Devil believes and trembles</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, is reſerved for an endleſs life, in that which we call the World to come, <hi>David</hi> ſaith <hi>Great plagues remain for the ungodly:</hi> though upon the ungodly, <hi>God raines ſnares, fire, and brimſton, ſtorm and tempeſt,</hi> and diſcharges whole Vollies of <hi>Wonderful plagues</hi> upon the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:65386:113"/>children of diſobedience, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.59. yet there is a reſerve of more and greater, and the biggeſt and worſt are ſtill behind. As the Saints have uſually the worſt in <hi>poſſeſſion,</hi> and beſt in <hi>reverſion,</hi> and this life is a ſowing in tears that they may reap in joy; ſo uſually the wicked have the <hi>beſt at firſt,</hi> and <hi>worſt at laſt,</hi> as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram</hi> ſaid to <hi>Dives, Son remember how in thy life time thou receivedſt thy good things, but Lazarus pains, but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</hi> But to return to take into further conſideration that expreſſion of wrath to come, Caſt abroad your eyes in all the world, and look back to the beginning of time, and enquire whether ever ſorrow were like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Weeping and Howling, and Gnaſhing of Teeth, which the Lord inflicts upon the Damned in the day of his fierce wrath.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We read that for our firſt Parents diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, the whole Creation was under ſuch a load of wrath, that ever ſince it hath <hi>groan'd under it:</hi> Rom. 8.22. But there we read al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that the creature groans under an expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of liberty, <hi>waiting when it ſhall be reſtor'd into the glorious liberty of the Sons God;</hi> but when this Damnation takes place, the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as they are eaſleſs, ſo ſhall they be endleſs; <hi>the worm dyeth not, and the fire never
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:65386:113"/>goes out,</hi> there is no hope of a deliverance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Its upon record that <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> were deſtroyed with Fire and Brimſton, but when the Cities were burnt the fire was extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht, but the wicked are the chaff and ſtubble that muſt be burnt with <hi>unquenchable fire,</hi> the damned, who are the fuel that feed; it ſhalbe like the burning buſh all on a fire but not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummed, and therefore the fire muſt needs be everlaſting; <hi>The burning thereof is fire and much wood, and the breath of the Lord like a River of brimſton doth kindle it.</hi> Iſay 30.33.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God overthrew the old World with a devouring floud, but the Scripture makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the riſing and raging of it, and then of its ebbing again, and flowing no more: But thoſe ſouls that are <hi>drowned in perdition,</hi> are caſt into the <hi>Mare mortuum,</hi> the dead, and deadly Sea, the Red and the Raging Sea of the Almighties wrath, which hath neither bank nor bottome, where they muſt be ſinking and drowning for ever and ever.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Jews</hi> for their rejecting Chriſt, were unchurched, and Excommunicated, but they are to be called again, when the fulneſs of the Gentiles is come in, But the ſentence of finall Damnation ſhalbe beyond the <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Maranatha,</hi> that was but till the coming of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:65386:114"/>Lord, but this commences at the coming of the Lord, and from thenceforth for ever, <hi>Go ye curſed into everlaſting fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we alſo promiſed to clear this point un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you by evidence of reaſon, as I did the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, for if ſuch truths were but believingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the evidence of them, they would ſurely be mighty in operation, and pierce <hi>to the dividing of the Soul and Spirit:</hi> If our everlaſting doors were but opened to entertain ſuch mighty Doctrines, can we think that men and women that have reaſonable Souls, and the principles of ſelf-love, and ſelf-preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them, and the paſsion of fear in them, I ſay can it be once imagined that they can be ſo bruitiſh to caſt away all care what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of them in another world, and with both hands to pull down upon bodies and ſouls this ſwift damnation. Know then that the damnation that we are treating of, which men draw upon their own heads by ſetting light by Goſpel-Salvation, is monſtrous great for theſe enſuing reaſons,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Reaſon, <hi>Becauſe it proceedeth from ſo great a God.</hi> If we would know the greatneſs of this Damnation, let us ſtudy the greatneſs of that God that inflicts it: <hi>The wrath of a King is like the roring of a Lyon;</hi> but let thoſe that
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:65386:114"/>can tell what the wrath of the King of Kings is: ſurely <hi>Moſes</hi> his words do advance it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all that can be ſpoken or thought of it: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.11. <hi>Who knows the power of thine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? for according to thy fear is thy wrath</hi> (i.e.) let ſuch as have the moſt enlightned and moſt enlarged underſtandings, graſpe as much as they can in comprehending thy diſpleaſure, yet when they are come unto their wits end, it is infinitly beyond their reach. The Lord doth all things like himſelf; <hi>If he do but ſpeak concerning a Nation, and concerning a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to build and to plant it,</hi> his very word will bring it to paſs, it brought the world out of nothing with as little ado, for he did but <hi>ſpeak the word and they were made, he commanded, and they were created:</hi> and again if he do but blow upon it, and ſpeak againſt it to deſtroy it, whether it be a Nation, or all the Nations of the world, he can command a Floud or a Fire to do his ſtrange work: When he will <hi>deliver,</hi> none can deliver like him, and when he will <hi>deſtroy,</hi> none can deſtroy like him. <hi>Davids</hi> queſtion puts all out of queſtion, that there is no reſiſtance to be made againſt him. <hi>Who may ſtand in his ſight when he is angry? Dare we provoke the Lord to jealouſie? oh fooliſh people and unwiſe, are we ſtronger than he?</hi> Can ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Though they could ſore as high as Heaven, or fall as low as Hell, or fly to the uttermoſt coaſts of the Earth, or Sea, though they ſhould lie buried under Mountaines a thouſand miles deep, or all the rocks of the Sea and Land were piled upon them, yet there is no hiding them from the wrath of this mighty God, who is no leſs omniſcient, than he is omnipotent. Thoſe that deſire to know more of the greatneſs of this God, let them ſtudy the 40 Chapter of <hi>Iſay.</hi> And there they ſhall find, v. 12. <hi>That he meaſureth the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the hollow of his hand, and metes the Heaven with a ſpan, and comprehends the duſt of the earth in a meaſure, and weighs the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines in ſcales, and the hills in a ballance.</hi> And v. 15. <hi>All nations are as a drop of a buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and are counted as the ſmall duſt of the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,</hi> and v. 17. <hi>All nations before him are as nothing, and they are counted leſs than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and vanity.</hi> And v. 22. <hi>It is he that ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth upon the circle of the earth, and the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants thereof are as graſhoppers, that ſtretcheth out the Heavens as curtaine, and ſpreadeth them
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:65386:115"/>out as a tent to dwell in. That bringeth the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to nothing, and maketh the Judges of the earth as vanity.</hi> Conſidering all this great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and conſidering further that one halfe is not told you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the more we ſtudy it the more we are overwhelmed, and confounded with the glory of it, what can be too hard for the Lord, or who can ſtand in the judgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this mighty God, <hi>to whom vengeance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth:</hi> We may eaſily be confirmed in the truth of all that is ſaid, &amp; all that can be ſaid of the greatneſs of damnation, when we do but hear from whence it comes, even from the dreadfull <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who is able with a word, or a frown, or a diſpleaſed breath to turn all the wicked into hell, and all the people that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get God.</p>

They had no deſire of God, and Chriſt, and happineſs, while they lived here, or no more but a carnal deſire, as <hi>Balaam</hi> deſired the death of the righteous without their life, ſo they deſired happineſs without holineſs, and glory without grace, and there the deſire of their Souls ſhall never be towards his name, or if they could never ſo much deſire to get out of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs pit, there can be no redemption.</p>

               <p>I might here enlarge upon all the ſenſes, as we did before upon the faculties, but the very torments of the Soul are the very Soul of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and do as far ſurpaſs bodily torment as the Soul doth the body.

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Heaven</hi> and Salvation is propoſed as the fourth matter of meditation, and both theſe laſt do follow Judgement, which ſends the Goats on the left hand to hell, and the Sheep on the right hand to heaven: The <hi>Libertines</hi> of the age would perſwade us that there is neither Hell nor Heaven, but what is in the conſcience; but let us aſſure our ſelves, if there were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hell or Heaven, there would be none there; if a conſcience excuſing in well doing did not flow from a Heaven in hope, and a conſcience accuſing for evil doing did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a hell in fear, ſurely there would be no ſuch conſciences; let the fancies of theſe vain men paſs for <hi>strong deluſions,</hi> and let us mind the <hi>true ſayings of the everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> which tell us, that as the <hi>wicked go into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting puniſhment, ſo the righteous into life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. Matth.</hi> 25. <hi>ult.</hi> How poſitively, and allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly doth the Scripture ſpeak of this bleſſed &amp; bleſſed making place, calling it <hi>the third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> 2 Cor. 12.2. <hi>The throne of God,</hi> I ſay 66.1. &amp;
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:65386:143"/>we are directed to prefer our petitions to him as <hi>our Father dwelling heaven, Mat.</hi> 6.9. <hi>An houſe not made with hands, eternall in the Heavens.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.1. the ſeat of the bleſſed. <hi>The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom prepared for them from the beginning of the world,</hi> Matth. 25.34. ſhadowed out by the <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> Heb. 12.22, 23, 24. and the <hi>new Jeruſalem,</hi> Revel. 21.10. to the end, wherein <hi>many excellent things are ſpoken of this City of God.</hi> But I have ſpoken ſo largely both of the <hi>Priſon</hi> of <hi>Hell,</hi> and the <hi>Paradiſe</hi> of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> in the antecedent Doctrines of Salvation &amp; Damnation, that the leſs may ſerve here. O what ſhould thoſe do with ſin that make it <hi>their refuge to lay hold on the hope that is ſet before them.</hi> Ther's no ſin in heaven, and if unclean ſinners ſhould be carryed thither in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, heaven would not be heaven to them; Its the Saints holineſs that makes hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven their happineſs, and the grace they bring thither that prepares them for that <hi>Joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and glorious.</hi> When we meet with temptations to ſin let us remember Hell, with its forerunners, death and judgement, and that will prompt us to ſay with <hi>Joſeph, How can I do this great wickedneſs and ſin againſt God?</hi> Gen. 39.9. And when we meet with tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from ſufferings, let us remember
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:65386:144"/>Heaven, and that will prompt us to ſay with <hi>Paul, I count that the afflictions of this preſent world are not worthy the glory which ſhalbe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.</hi> When we are inticed to ſin, let us ſit down and count the coſt, it may coſt our lives, it may coſt our precious Souls, it may looſe us Heaven and Salvation for eternity; and when we are diſcouraged in the waies of God, in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out our ſelves to be wail our ſins, to treaſure up grace, to perform duty, and not be weary of well doing, to ſuffer patiently whatſoever can befall us for Chriſt's ſake, then let us ſit down and count our gain: It will make us live comfortably, it will give us hope in death, it will give us boldneſs in Judgement, it will ſave us from hell, it will advance us to Heaven.</p>
                  <p>To wind up all let me ſpeak cloſe to you as once <hi>Paul</hi> did to <hi>Agrippa,</hi> as if he would offer violence to force his belief: <hi>O Agrippa, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt thou the Scriptures? I know thou believeſt.</hi> you that have read or heard theſe Lines do you believe theſe things? I know you believe them; they are ſo ſet out in the <hi>demonſtration of the Spirit, and in power,</hi> that you cannot gain-ſay them; and if you cannot contradict them, will you not believe them?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Do you believe Goſpel-Salvation to be great Salvation?</hi> The Angels believe it and admire
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:65386:144"/>it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. The Saints believe it and adore it, <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.11, 13. <hi>The number of them that gave glory to God was ten thouſand times ten thouſand, and thouſands of thouſands, and every creature in Heaven, and earth and ſea were heard to ſay, Bleſsing, Honour, Glory, and Power, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that ſitteth upon the Throne, and to the Lambe for ever and ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Devils believe and envy it. The dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned believe it, and the loſs of it is that never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying worm that renders them reſtleſs; and whether you will now believe it or no, the time is coming when you will believe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it with hearts as full of anguiſh, as ever they can hold: O believe it now and be happy for ever, and the Lord help your unbelief, and make you believers by <hi>the exceeding greatneſs of his Omnipotent Power, and according to the working of his mighty power;</hi> Oh that the King of Saints would command thoſe everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting doors of your underſtandings and wills to be opened to give entrance to the King of glory; that you may imbrace, and receive thankfully this great Salvation, that you may live and dye upon the faithfulneſs and truth of that acceptable and accepted ſaying. <hi>That Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt came into the World to ſave ſinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Do you believe Goſpel neglecting to be great
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:65386:145"/>ſin?</hi> Thoſe that are truely inlightned, &amp; touched with the fear of God do think ſo: thoſe that are under the convictions, and compunctions of the Spirit of bondage for this ſin do think ſo, they are ready to depend, and give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as loſt, and utterly undone under the load of it; this is ſtill ready at hand to make up the ſum totall of their confeſſions, we have added to all our tranſgreſſions of thy law this Monſter, that we have reſiſted and ſlighted thy gracious Goſpel. <hi>Againſt thee, thee have we ſinned and done this evil:</hi> O be mercifull to our ſin, to this of all ſins, for it is great. The infinite mercy of God and merit of Chriſt; and mighty Spirit of grace and adoption, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing, offering,</hi> and <hi>applying</hi> that mercy and merit as balſome to the wounded Spirit, hath much ado to bear it up from ſinking under ſo inſupportable a burden. Inlightned ſinners will believe it at the laſt, when they are under the arreſt of death, then they will be ready with <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Spira</hi> to fill all the ears about them with their deſpairing complaints, then they could <hi>ſeek the bleſsing with tears</hi> as <hi>Eſau</hi> did, &amp; could be content to fill heaven and earth with their roarings, if that would help them; Believe it, <hi>Sirs,</hi> the Devil that tempts you to make light of this Salvation now, and preſents
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:65386:145"/>it as a <hi>Molehill,</hi> will then turn the other end of the proſpective, and make it as bigg as a <hi>Mountain,</hi> and perſwade you it is <hi>greater than that it can be forgiven.</hi> How much better were it that you ſhould now believingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in this truth in the power of it, that <hi>where ſin hath abounded grace may ſuper-abound,</hi> and that you may in time leave and loath this ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be your everlaſting undoing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Do you believe that Great Damnation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for ſuch as dye in this ſin?</hi> that <hi>the wrath of God abides on them here, and a ſorer puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and more fiery indignation</hi> will abide on them (if converſion prevent not) world without end? Thoſe that are in hell already do believe it, yea, they know not how to evade the believing it. They do curſe thoſe <hi>Mountebank</hi> Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers that <hi>heal mens wound with oyly words,</hi> that ſpeak <hi>Placentia,</hi> things that may pleaſe itching ears, rather than things that may profit unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving hearts. Yea, they do charge it heavily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their deceiv'd &amp; own deceitful hearts, that when they <hi>heard the words of the Curſe,</hi> and threats of Damnation cauſed them to <hi>bleſs themſelves</hi> in their curſed practiſes, though they <hi>added drunkenneſs to thirſt,</hi> and Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refuſing to Law-tranſgreſſing, till all curſes written and unwritten came in tumbling upon
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:65386:146"/>them like mighty waters. How much better were it for men to carry about with them a hell in their conſciences, than to be carryed captive by the Devils into this hell of torments? How much eaſier were it for them to deſcend every day into hell by meditation, than at their dying day to be doom'd unto hell by condemnation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pliny</hi> writes of the <hi>Lions whelps</hi> that he is at firſt much given to Sleeping, but being once awakened, &amp; ſcared with the hideous roaring of the old Lion, ſleeps ever after with his eyes open; The application is to our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe very pertinent. Thoſe that ſet light by Salvation are much given to ſleeping; they hear in the Text Damnation thundred out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch ſleepers, like the roaring of a Lion Rampant; I heartily wiſh that this uſe may be made of it, that our conſciences may be ſo throughly awakened, to ſee our ſin and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and duty, that we may alwaies ſleep with the eye of conſcience open, and that we may reſolve not to ſuffer our <hi>eyes to ſleep, nor our eye-lids to ſlumber, nor the temples of our heads to take any reſt,</hi> till we have made this <hi>great ſin our great Lamentation;</hi> till we have great and grounded probability of eſcaping this great Damnation, and till we have <hi>believed,</hi> and <hi>prayed,</hi> and <hi>lived</hi> our ſelves into ſome
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:65386:146"/>ſetled and imfalliable perſwaſions of our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of this great Salvation. All which the Lord give grace unto his choſen people effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually to perform, for his great names ſake, for his beloved Sons ſake, for his gracious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſake. <hi>And the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the love of God, and the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Holy Ghoſt be with you all,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.14.

                     <hi>Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly, above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, unto him be glory in the Church by Chriſt Jeſus, throughout all ages, world without end,</hi> Amen.</p>
